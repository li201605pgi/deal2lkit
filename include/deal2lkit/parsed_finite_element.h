/**
 * Parsed FiniteElement. Read from a parameter file the name of a
 * finite element, generate one for you, and return a pointer to it.
 *
 * The name must be in the form which is returned by the
 * FiniteElement::get_name() function, where dimension template
 * parameters <2> etc. can be omitted. Alternatively, the explicit
 * number can be replaced by `dim` or `d`. If a number is given, it
 * must match the template parameter of this function.
 *
 * The names of FESystem elements follow the pattern
 * `FESystem[FE_Base1^p1-FE_Base2^p2]` The powers p1 etc. may either be
 * numbers or can be replaced by dim or d.
 *
 * If no finite element can be reconstructed from this string, an
 * exception of type FETools::ExcInvalidFEName is thrown.
 *
 * The operator() returns a pointer to a newly create finite element. It
 * is in the caller's responsibility to destroy the object pointed to
 * at an appropriate later time.
 *
 * Since the value of the template argument can't be deduced from the
 * (string) argument given to this function, you have to explicitly
 * specify it when you call this function.
 *
 * This function knows about all the standard elements defined in the
 * library. However, it doesn't by default know about elements that
 * you may have defined in your program. To make your own elements
 * known to this function, use the add_fe_name() function.

   * Declare possible parameters of this class.
   *
   * The first parameter which is declared here is "Finite element
   * space". The parameter must be in the form which is returned by
   * the FiniteElement::get_name function, where dimension template
   * parameters <2> etc. can be omitted. Alternatively, the explicit
   * number can be replaced by dim or d. If a number is given, it must
   * match the template parameter of this function.
   *
   * The names of FESystem elements follow the pattern
   * FESystem[FE_Base1^p1-FE_Base2^p2] The powers p1 etc. may either be
   * numbers or can be replaced by dim or d.
   *
   * If no finite element can be reconstructed from this string, an
   * exception of type FETools::ExcInvalidFEName is thrown.
   *
   * The operator() returns a pointer to a newly create finite element. It
   * is in the caller's responsibility to destroy the object pointed to
   * at an appropriate later time.
   *
   * The second parameter is "Block names". This is comma separeted
   * list of component names which identifies the Finite Elemenet. If
   * a name is repeated, then that component is assumed to be part of
   * a vector field or Tensor field, and is treated as a single
   * block. User classes can use this information to construct block
   * matrices and vectors, or to group solution names according to
   * components. For example, a Stokes problem may have "u,u,p" for
   * dim = 2 or "u, u, u, p" for dim = 3.
   *
   * The third parameter defined by this function is "Block coupling",
   * which is semicolumn separated list of comma separated indices
   * from 0 to 2 (included), representing a table of coupling between
   * the components (or the blocks). The default for this parameter is
   * the empty string, which is interpreted as "all components couple
   * with all other components". You can specify a block wise coupling
   * (with two blocks, this would be a 2x2 matrix) or a component wise
   * coupling (if a block is made of more than one component, but not
   * all components of the same block couple with the other
   * components). The numbers are interpreted as: 0=DoFTools::none,
   * 1=DoFTools::always, 2=DoFTools::nonzero.
